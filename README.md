# MSc_Thesis
Some code used in my analysis of brook trout populations for my MSc thesis at the University of Calgary.

The BACI_effect_sims.R was an exercise in understanding how to estimate BACI effects and seeing if they could be used to estimate effects from unbalanced observaitons, sites, or differing effect sizes at multiple sites. This was the basis of chapter 3 in my thesis. 

flagging_data_with_dplyr.R is a file that introduces how to create "data flags" that can be checked when going through field notes and looking for errors. It uses a generic mtcars data set but can be tailored to any data. It introduces a foundation for flagging data I wanted to share.
